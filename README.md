# My Awesome Project
This a simple app that I made so I can update my shopping list in real time, from anywhere!.

![Heoku Deployment](https://ctd-shopping-list.herokuapp.com/)

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Heroku

I started by building this in node/express and wanted it to connect to a MongoDB database. Then I added the .ejs file and javascript to make it work in browser. Fromt here I deployed it to Heroku so it would be running live!

## Optimizations

I may update this app so that it separates the sections instead of simply organizing them alphabetically. Visual updates to come as well. 

## Lessons Learned:

I had trouble with my initial deployment. It was returning a server error and I had forgotten 2 things! My package.json file's "main" was not the same as my root server file name. Also, when building the app originally, I only had my PC's IP address whitelisted. So I enabled all IPs to make modifications and it worked perfectly.
